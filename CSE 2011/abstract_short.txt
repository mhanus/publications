The highly efficient nodal methods have originated in the nuclear engineering
community, where they quickly overshadowed the more demanding FVM or low-order FEM.
To our best knowledge, though, nodal methods received little attention in other engineering fields, where the FEM were more dominant. In an effort to clarify their relationship, we will solve a neutron diffusion problem with both an hp-adaptive FEM and a transverse integrated nodal method and discuss their similarities and differences.
