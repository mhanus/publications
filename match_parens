== match_parens - find mismatches of parentheses, braces, (angle) brackets, in texts

== Synopsis

	match_parens [_filename_]

== Description

Mismatches of parentheses, braces, (angle) brackets, especially in TeX
sources which may be rich in those, may be difficult to trace. This
little script helps you by writing your text to standard output, after
adding a left margin to your text, which will normally be almost empty,
but will clearly show any mismatches. (Just try me on myself to see that
the parenthesis starting this sentence will not appear to be matched at
the end of the file. If you look at me in the vim editor, try the command
:%!%
